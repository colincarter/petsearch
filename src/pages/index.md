  title: A reliable and friendly service
  description: >
    At Petsearch Register of Lost & Found Pets, we are a voluntary service that aims to reunite lost pets with their owners. The service has been going for nearly 20 years and is the only group of its kind in the area. Over 300 people have called us in the past year and we are proud to say well over half of the lost animals have been returned to their owners. If you're looking for a missing pet in the Lancaster area, contact us today.

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

        We appreciate that your pet going missing can be upsetting, however the 
        more information you can give us, the better the chance of finding them. 
        We will want as much information as possible about your lost pet - 
        names, male or female, whether your pet is neutered and/or microchipped,
        their colour, whether they have a collar, and any special features. 
        Photos or videos are a great help.
        Alternatively, if you've found a pet, let us know. Chances are that pet
        belongs to someone who is desperately hoping to be reunited.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
